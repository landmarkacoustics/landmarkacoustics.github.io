# How to Write a Business Plan

There is, of course, no single way to write a business plan. I have looked at
some videos on LinkedIn Learning, and posted the notes in the pages below.

[Mike Figliuolo's Plan](figliuolo.md)
: This actually spoke to me more than any other business plan guide that I have
  ever seen. It's a pretty reasonable structure that lays out the logic and
  story behind the business idea. There are places for bullshit tables of
  overly-optimistic projections, but most of the document is justification for
  why the projections aren't bullshit.
  
[Do it Yourself](wealthfit.md)
: This was shit and I don't recommend reading it, but I include it here because
  my notes contain some worthwhile thoughts of my own.

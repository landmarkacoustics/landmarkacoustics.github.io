## Style Guide

MkDocs uses Markdown, which handles line breaks differently from LaTeX. \
For that reason, don't start a new line for each sentence. \
Use line-wrapping and just keep adding sentences to the paragraph. \
I know. \
You say "Ben, Markdown ignores line breaks unless you have a double-space "  " at the end of a line. \
Normally, you are correct. \
However, this behavior doesn't work in lists, whether they are definitions, bullets, or ordered items.

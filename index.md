# How-Tos for Landmark Acoustics LLC

These how-tos collect what I have learned as I build the tools for
[Landmark Acoustics LLC](https://www.landmarkacoustics.com). Right now, they
are organized by task, but I may organize them by language in the future.

## [Code Standards](standards/)

We write software in several languages, including

- [R](standards/rstats.md)
- [JavaScript](standards/javascript.md)
- [C++](standards/cpp.md)
- [Python](standards/python.md)

## [Setup](setup/)

The original impetus for making this site was to keep track of how to set up
things like webservers and Django sites. So far, I have accumulated "wisdom"
for setting up:

# [Applications](applications/)

Right now, the only thing in here is thoughts on structuring the javascript
application for [recording audio](applications/javascript.md)

# [Business Concepts](biz/)

Business tools include documents that people need to follow what you are doing,
or plan to do.
